## Observations

### API

- Dog breed should have properly cased text
- Batch loading (reduced network-spam) and more likely better system throughput

### Mockup

- Some spacings are 5-based, such as space between tiles, or space between icon and label
- Some spacings are 4-based, such as space between menu items
